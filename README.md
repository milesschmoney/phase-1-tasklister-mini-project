# TaskLister – Phase 1 JavaScript Project

## Description
TaskLister is a simple single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
It allows users to add tasks dynamically to a list without reloading the page.

## Features
- User input handled through a form
- Event-driven updates using JavaScript
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Single-page application behavior

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## How It Works
- The page loads and queries required DOM elements
- A submit event listener captures user input
- The default form behavior is prevented
- New tasks are created and appended to the DOM dynamically

## Learning Goals Demonstrated
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Preventing default browser behavior
- Updating the UI without page reload
